# Fibonacci Stretch

Stretch the rhythm of an audio track along the Fibonacci sequence.

See [fibonaccistretch.ipynb](nbs/fibonaccistretch.ipynb) for a more detailed writeup and implementation (note: the outputs are cleared, so to see figures and listen to audio you'll need to run the notebook using Jupyter). A static HTML version is also available [here](http://usdivad.com/fibonaccistretch).

Or take a listen to an [example result](data/out_humannature_90s_stretched.mp3) (first 90 seconds of Michael Jackson's "Human Nature", Fibonacci stretched by a factor of 1 using input rhythm `[1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0]`).
